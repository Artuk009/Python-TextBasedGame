# Python-TextBasedGame

Text based game displaying some basic Python knowledge obtained through my coursework. Utilized dictionaries, defined functions, and if/else statments to create the functionality of my game. Navigate rooms in the movie theater and collect all of the perk-a-colas to escape Dr. Richtofen. (Huge CoD zombies fan!)
